# :lock: Password Generator

It's a basic password generator where you need to put the length you want in your password as also the subject so you remember what you generated that password for. The program generates a random password using letters, numbers, and punctuation and in the final saves the data in a txt file.

Hope you enjoy it! ðŸ‘½
